    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p style="font-size:14px">Bhagat Singh (1907–1931) was one of the most influential revolutionaries of the Indian freedom struggle. Born on 28 September 1907 in Banga village, Punjab (now in Pakistan), he grew up in a patriotic family deeply involved in the fight against British rule. Inspired by freedom fighters like Kartar Singh Sarabha and movements like the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Bhagat Singh dedicated his life to the cause of India’s independence.

He was a brilliant student, a powerful writer, and a fearless leader. Along with his comrades, he founded revolutionary groups such as the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) to fight British oppression. He gained national fame when he and Batukeshwar Dutt threw bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly in 1929, shouting the slogan “Inquilab Zindabad” (“Long Live the Revolution”) to protest against unjust laws.

Bhagat Singh was arrested and later tried for his role in the killing of British officer John Saunders. Despite being only 23 years old, he faced his execution with courage and dignity. On 23 March 1931, Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, was hanged in Lahore Jail.

Today, Bhagat Singh is remembered as Shaheed (Martyr) Bhagat Singh, a symbol of courage, sacrifice, and resistance against oppression. His ideas of equality, justice, and revolution continue to inspire generations.</p>
